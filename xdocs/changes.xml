    <release version="1.0.2-dev" date="in SVN">
    <action type="update" dev="tv">
        Important change: The BaseValueParser now consistently returns null for 
        all get-methods that return an Object, if the parameter name does not exist.
        This changes the behaviour of getBigDecimal which used to return 0 in this 
        case.
    </action>
    <action type="add" dev="tv">
        Made ValueParser and BaseValueParser locale-aware. Note that the default
        locale used is always the default value of the JVM which is different from 
        the previous behaviour where the locale used was sometimes Locale.US (for
        float, double and BigDecimal) and sometimes the JVM-default (for dates).
    </action>

        parser objects.
